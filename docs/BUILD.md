# Build Guide

QontrolPanel is a Windows desktop application built with Qt 6, CMake, MSVC 2022, vcpkg, hidapi, and a vendored HeadsetControl library.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or newer.
- Git for Windows.
- Visual Studio 2022 with the `Desktop development with C++` workload.
- CMake 3.30 or newer.
- Ninja or the Visual Studio CMake generator.
- Qt 6.9 or newer for MSVC 2022 64-bit.
- vcpkg installed at `C:\vcpkg` or passed explicitly through `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`.
- vcpkg packages:
  - `hidapi:x64-windows`
  - `getopt-win32:x64-windows` for the vendored HeadsetControl build.

The CI workflow currently uses Qt `6.10.1` on `windows-2022`.

## Clone

Clone with submodules:

```pwsh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ChrisLauinger77/QontrolPanel.git
cd QontrolPanel
```

If the repository was cloned without submodules:

```pwsh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

The build fails early if `dependencies/headsetcontrol/CMakeLists.txt` is missing.

## Install Dependencies

Install or update vcpkg:

```pwsh
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git C:\vcpkg
C:\vcpkg\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
```

Install native packages:

```pwsh
C:\vcpkg\vcpkg install hidapi:x64-windows getopt-win32:x64-windows
```

Install Qt with the online installer. Select the MSVC 2022 64-bit kit for a stable Qt 6 release. Keep Qt Creator, CMake, and Ninja enabled.

## Configure

From a Visual Studio 2022 developer shell, Qt Creator, or another environment where Qt and MSVC are available:

```pwsh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
```

Useful optional arguments:

```pwsh
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=C:/Qt/6.10.1/msvc2022_64
```

When using a multi-config generator such as Visual Studio, pass the build configuration during build and install instead of relying on `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`.

## Build

```pwsh
cmake --build build --config Release
```

The build produces the `QontrolPanel` executable and also updates Qt translation source files through the `update_translations` dependency.

## Run Locally

During development, the easiest path is to run from Qt Creator with the configured kit.

If running manually, close any already-running QontrolPanel instance first. The application enforces a single instance through a local server named `QontrolPanel`; starting another instance sends `show_panel` to the existing process and exits.

## Install and Deploy Runtime Files

```pwsh
cmake --install build --config Release
```

The install step copies the executable, Qt runtime dependencies, QML dependencies, translations, and `hidapi.dll` when CMake can find it in the vcpkg installation.

By default, this project sets:

```cmake
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/install
```

The installed app will normally be under:

```text
build/install/bin/QontrolPanel.exe
```

## Common Build Issues

### HeadsetControl submodule is missing

Run:

```pwsh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### hidapi package not found

Install the vcpkg package and make sure CMake uses the vcpkg toolchain:

```pwsh
C:\vcpkg\vcpkg install hidapi:x64-windows
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
```

### Qt package not found

Set `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to the Qt MSVC kit, or configure from Qt Creator:

```pwsh
cmake -S . -B build `
  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake `
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=C:/Qt/6.10.1/msvc2022_64
```

### The app starts but immediately exits

Another QontrolPanel instance is probably running. Close the tray app or kill the existing process before launching the development build.

### Runtime cannot find Qt/QML dependencies

Run the install step. The project uses Qt deployment helpers during install; running directly from the raw build output may miss runtime files depending on the environment.

## CI Build

The main build workflow:

1. Checks out the repository with submodules.
2. Updates the HeadsetControl submodule to the latest upstream master for the workflow run.
3. Extracts the app version from `CMakeLists.txt`.
4. Sets up MSVC and vcpkg.
5. Installs Qt.
6. Configures, builds, and installs Release.
7. Cleans changed translation files.
8. Uploads a ZIP artifact.
9. Builds an Inno Setup installer.

Local builds should usually use the checked-out submodule revision unless you are intentionally validating an upstream HeadsetControl update.
